Hi! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, TN, USA, advised by Prof. [Taylor T. Johnson](http://www.taylortjohnson.com/) and Prof. [Kevin Leach](https://kjl.name/).
My research focuses on enhancing AI's robustness, generalizability, and trustworthiness and the intersection of these topics, especially in federated learning and computer vision.
Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree from [School of Information and Communication Technology](https://soict.hust.edu.vn/en/) at [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](hust.edu.vn) in October 2022. 
I have always loved pushing myself to go beyond my limits, and I am definitely a lifelong learner.
